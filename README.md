# D3-Visualization
D3 visualization created based on mental health and physical health data.

#### Build your visualization
* `index.html` is the page that gets served.  We attach our JS to this file.
*  `d3-visualization.js` is the JS that gets rendered on our page.  This is where the D3 gets coded. 

#### Start your Visualization
* In order to avoid a CORS network error, we must run a temporary server rather than serving our HTML from our filesytem.
* To do this, we must run a simple command in our project folder that will bring up a temporary server:  
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* If your localhost doesn't come up automatically, go to `http://localhost:8000/`
